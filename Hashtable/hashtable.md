# Code Challenge 30 Hash Table
## Description: 
This challenge is to implement a Hash Table data structure using separate chaining for collision resolution.
*****
## approach and efficiency : 
I used a lot of methods to implement the code like set ,get , keys and has methods. 
HashTable class provides O(1) average time complexity for individual operations under the assumption of a good hash function and a reasonable load factor. However, it can degrade to O(N) in the worst-case scenario with many collisions. The space complexity mainly depends on the number of unique key-value pairs in the hashtable and is o(n).
