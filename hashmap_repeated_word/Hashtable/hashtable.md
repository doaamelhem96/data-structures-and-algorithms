# Code Challenge 30 Hash Table

## approach and efficiency : 
HashTable class provides O(1) average time complexity for individual operations under the assumption of a good hash function and a reasonable load factor. However, it can degrade to O(N) in the worst-case scenario with many collisions. The space complexity mainly depends on the number of unique key-value pairs in the hashtable and is o(n).
