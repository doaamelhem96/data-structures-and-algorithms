### approach and effecincy :
- First we split all sentences into individual words using space delimiter, then convert them to lowercase for case,return the first repeated word if there any word repeated else return None

Big (O) : Time ComplexityÂ  o (n)

Space Complexity  o (n)
### To test the code run:
```
pytest
```
### To run the code :
```
