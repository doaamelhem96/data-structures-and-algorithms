Approach and Efficiency:
The chosen approach involves iterating through the keys of the first hashmap and performing constant-time operations for each key.  The algorithm efficiently handles the LEFT JOIN logic and returns the desired result as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of data containing the key, synonym, and antonym (if present).
Big(o):Time complexity : o(n)
Space Complexity:O(n)
